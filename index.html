    <p>It began in Los Angeles, California in the mid-to-late 1940s and during the post-war prosperity of the 1950s. Initially, some Mexican-American youths lowered blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed the frames and dropped spindles. The aim of the lowriders is to cruise as slowly as possible, "Low and Slow" being their motto. By redesigning these cars in ways that go against their intended purposes and in painting their cars so that they reflect and hold meanings from Mexican culture, lowriders create cultural and political statements that go against the more prevalent Anglo culture. The design of the cars encouraged a "bi-focal perspective-they are made to be watched but only after adjustments have been made to provide ironic and playful commentary on prevailing standard of automobile design."However, this resulted in a backlash: the enactment of Section 24008 of the California Vehicle Code in January 1, 1958, which made it illegal to operate any car modified so that any part was lower than the bottoms of its wheel rims. </p>

    <p> “Lowrider” is the name used for cars transformed into cultural expressions and for the dedicated aficionados who make and drive them. The way that gave the vehicles named,"Lowriders" were Hydraulics. Hydraulics are distinguishing feature of the modern lowrider.Lowrider hydraulics were originally aircraft hydraulic systems (pumps, dumps, cylinders). Young Chicanos attached this gear to the undercarriage of cars to create an adjustable suspension. Riders could flip a switch to raise a car’s body a few inches to glide safely over an obstacle and to pass a police inspection, and then flip the switch back, returning the car to its low, cool, pavement-scraping stance. This evolved into dramatic up-and-down bouncing, known as hopping. That thus creating the mobile masterpieces made by lowriders embrace art, family, and religion. The lacquered bodies of lowrider cars glow with brilliant colors, geometric patterns, religious symbols, and velvet trim. Unlike hot rods and other racing cars, lowriders were designed to parade slowly. Each car is lowered within inches of the pavement and driven as a rolling work of art.</p>

      <p> At first, lowriders were only seen in places like LA, especially back in the 1970s on Whittier Boulevard when lowriding came to its peak. Whittier was a wide commercial street that cut through the barrio of the city in Los Angeles, California. On Saturday nights, young Mexican Americans went cruising along Whittier in their lowriders. Lowriders nowadays have gotten fairly popular: lowriders can be seen all over the country from coast to coast, but recently they have been spreading to other places around the world. There's tons of custom-built lowriders are exported to Europe, Japan, and other parts of the world but most of all, Lowriding culture has spread to Japan.

  With the exposure of Chicano culture in Japan, the lowrider community began to grow in Japan as locals became interested in the car culture. Lowrider Japan is a magazine that was created in the '80s and sold in Japan thanks to the increased interest of lowriders in Japan. Junichi Shimodaira was known to be the grandfather of the lowriders in Japan since he was one of the first importers of these cars. Shimordaira continues to import and sell these cars through his business, Paradise Road. The spread of lowrider culture and the fame of Paradise Road even raised the attention of Ed Roth, who is famous for creating custom cars such as hot rods and a prominent figure in Kustom Kulture. Since the introduction of lowriders in Japan and the rise of lowriders in Japan in 2001, it is estimated that there are still 200 car clubs that are related to the lowrider scene that are still active to this day.</p>

      <p> Today, lowriders are seldom seen on the street in the great numbers of the '70s - political pressure, enforced by the police, have generated clamp-downs in many communities. But organized lowrider shows and hopping competitions take place in many cities, including L.A., San Francisco, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, and Miami. Lowrider magazine conducts many such shows annually around the country and counts more than 200,000 attendees and some 10,000 vehicles, according to publisher Chris Kobran, who notes that the U.S. has more than 500 lowrider clubs.A lowrider community has also developed among African Americans; for example, hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg is an avid fan. Whites and Asian Americans, exposed to the cars through music videos and on TV, have also adopted the style to some degree.</p>
